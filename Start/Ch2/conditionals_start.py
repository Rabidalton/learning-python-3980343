# Example file for working with conditional statements


x, y = 10, 1000

# conditional flow uses if, elif, else
# if (x < y):
#   print("x is less than y")
# elif x == y:
#   print("X is the same is y.")
# else: 
#   print("x is greater than y")

# conditional statements let you use "a if C else b"
result = "y is greater than x" if (y > x) else "Y is less than x"
print(result)
